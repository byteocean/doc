<b>BEWARE</b>

The code here intentionally contains errors ie a lot of it is for illustration
purposes only ie if I answer a question on stackoverflow I'll add the code here
and quite often the answer may be showing a particulr type of Bug. I'll try and
mark items up with <b>@bug</b> but don't rely on it. I'm also not tryiung
particularly hard to make it leak free or check every return value etc..
